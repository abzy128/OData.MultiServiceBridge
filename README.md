# OData.MultiServiceBridge

Library that allows execuing OData queries on data gateway servers.
This is best suited for microservice architecture. 
You can setup basic OData endpoints on your microservices make composed models on the gateway.
This way you can loosely couple your services(cascading deletion are done using events).

## TODO

- [ ] Implement a library. xD
